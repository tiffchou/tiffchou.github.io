      That first day hiking alone was hard. It was some grueling climbing that day, and I felt some serious loneliness. I saw other hikers on trail, but I felt so very small, hiking alone for the first time on the PCT, knowing I had a couple thousand miles ahead of me.
      <br><br>

      Not only that, but it had rained previously, and all the vegetation was covered in water. This section was covered in overgrown sections of trail, and apparently I was one of the first to hike through the overgrowth since it rained last night/earlier in the morning, so walking through it knocked all of the water onto my shoes. My shoes and socks were absolutely soaked the entire day.
      <br><br>
      When I reached the bottom of a large descent, and was preparing to start a long climb, I broke down and started crying. Everything felt so overwhelming: the loneliness, the amount of trail I had left, the climb coming up, the weight of my pack, even the vastness of the wildneress…

      <br>
      I felt a lot better after the cry.
      <br><br>
      I decided to set up camp earlier than I had planned. There were a couple other tents set up there at this large campsite, but we all stayed in our tents as it was raining. I went to sleep that night feeling very alone and small.

      <br>
      The next day, I planned to make it to Rainy Pass, and camp as close as possible to the North Cascades National Park boundary without crossing it. This is a 17-mile section we’re not allowed to camp in without an additional permit, so most people just hike through it.

      <br>
      When I was a few miles out from Rainy Pass, I decided to take my shoes and socks off to air out my feet on a nice rock with a gorgeous view. As I was putting my shoes and socks back on, another SOBO hiker walked up to me and said hello.
      <br><br>
      My first trail friend! Oli and I started chatting and hiking together, and ended up hiking all the way to Rainy Pass together. It wasn’t until we reached Rainy Pass that I realized we had never even asked for the other person’s name. That’s how fast making friends on the trail can happen.
      <br><br>
      When we walked past Rainy Pass, we saw a tiny northern terminus monument someone had made, presumably left from 2018 (the previous year), when the northernmost stretch of the PCT was closed due to fires. I’m glad that the NOBO hikers who couldn’t make it to the terminus because of this closure in 2018 were still able to sort of get a photo with the monument.

      <br>
      That night, I camped with many other people (including my new friend, Oli) just a mile before the North Cascades NP boundary -- seems like it was a popular idea! It was a lot of fun to hang out with so many other hikers, and by the end of the night, that lonely feeling I had had the day before was almost gone.

      The next day, we all got up early because we were all looking forward to town day in Stehekin. It was a very long 17-mile descent into a valley, and at the bottom, there would be a shuttle waiting to take us to showers, laundry, and warm food.
      <br><br>
      Stehekin was a great little town, right on the shores of Lake Chelan. The shuttle stops by the Stehekin bakery, and since I can’t have dairy without feeling like garbage, I was so excited to see they had some vegan snacks for me! When we got to Stehekin, I grabbed my resupply box from the post office, and snagged a chair on the General Store porch to start charging up my stuff. I spent the rest of the afternoon on the porch with a couple dozen other hikers. There, I also met Blue, who I’d eventually hike many miles with. He was doing a portrait project of thru-hikers, and asked for my portrait. What better time to do it than before I’d showered and done laundry?
      <br><br>
      One of the reasons I was excited to reach Stehekin was that there was supposed to be WiFi at the General Store, so I would be able to reach my family back home and let them know I was alright. Since I’d reached Hart’s Pass, I hadn’t gotten a single bar of service anywhere. The North Cascades truly are wilderness. Unfortunately, the WiFi didn’t work with certain phones, and of course I just happened to have one of those phones. Oli was nice enough to let me use his phone briefly to send a few messages home.

      That night, I camped right next to the water in town. I was feeling reenergized after making friends, taking a shower, and doing my laundry, and I was ready for the huge climb out of Stehekin.
