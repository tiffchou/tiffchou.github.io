            Dear Mount San Jacinto,
            <br><br>
            How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways.
            <br><br>
            Seriously though, that was a tough day. 
            <br><br>
            I had camped right past Interstate 10 that night, totally alone, and just far enough away from the highway so it was quiet. 
            <br><br>
            It was a few miles to the bottom of the mountain the next morning, where I'd see the last water source for about 20 miles and 7,000 feet in elevation gain. It was a great water fountain, provided by the Desert Water Agency. Thank you for the great and vital water source! I cameled up <i>good</i> here, and took a few minutes to mentally prepare myself for my pack to be stupidly heavy for this huge climb. 
            <br><br>

              <br>
              Wasn't sure which of those big things was Mount San Jacinto, but I knew one hell of a climb was a-coming
            </div>
            <br>
            There wasn't a single flat trail segment I can remember. It was relentless. A lot of the climb was surprisingly steep, and shade was minimal on that incredibly hot, sunny, waterless day. One nice thing about that day was I could turn around and literally see just how much progress I'd made because there wasn't anything blocking my view. I could see the highway I'd crossed the night prior behind me pretty much the whole day. 
            <br><br>
            I did reach the 2,450-mile marker for SOBOs, and I felt excited this time. As sad as I was just a couple hundred miles back to almost be done, at that point I was ready to stop walking soon. I had been pulling very big days for the most part up until I hit San Jacinto, with most of my full days approaching 30 miles. I loved the trail life, but I wanted to touch that southern monument!

            <br>
            I had planned to make it further than I actually did, at least to the next water source, but I was totally spent about 21 miles into the day, so I decided to just set up camp at the first spot I saw.

            <br>
            I was lucky because I saw a very tiny water cache at a campground I'd walked past a few miles before camp, which I found out later Ctrl+Z and Katie had left behind for me when they came across some trail magic from a friend there earlier in the day. I had messaged them earlier in the day saying I wasn't sure I'd make it to the first water source on the mountain, and they decided to help me out. You guys are the best!

              Hiking late into the night
            </div>
            <br>
            The summit isn't actually on the trail, but there is a trail network around there, so you don't have to backtrack to the trail if you do it. It's not really much additional mileage (about a mile more than if you just hike the actual PCT), but it is quite a bit of extra elevation gain (about 2,500 ft). I hadn't actually decided whether or not I was going to summit until I got to the junction where you'd turn left to summit or right to continue on the (relatively flat) PCT. 
            <br><br>
            I decided I'd probably regret it later if I didn't summit because I was so close. It was also still early in the day, so I had plenty of time to make up mileage on the descent. Well, that final climb wasn't any easier than the rest of it, but it was in the shade, which I sincerely appreciated. 
            <br><br>
            I stopped at the hiker hut near the top, which seemed like a really cool place to spend the night, if I had made it up here the night prior. I heard later that Ctrl+Z and Katie had decided to stop here the night before and got to see the sunrise at the summit.
            <br><br>

            <br>
            Then I headed up to the summit, where I completely lost the trail (I'm still not actually sure if there is a clear trail up there or not) but just started heading up. I was alone at the summit, and I'm not going to lie â€” it felt good to be up there! I was proud of myself for deciding to summit.
