            The hike down was beautiful and easy, but it felt <i>so long</i>. Initially, I was going to try to get to Idyllwild, my next resupply stop, from Mount San Jacinto, but I decided to push on to Highway 74 another 25 miles or so ahead and hitch in from there. There was supposed to be a snowstorm coming in a couple days, and I was trying to plan a single zero to coincide with that storm. This extra push would do it.

            <br>
            Unfortunately, because I hadn't planned for this extra day in my resupply, I ran out of food, and had very little battery left on my phone. Oh well. It was almost town day, and I had just summited a huge mountain. 
            <br><br>
            Plus, the whole descent did have a distinctly Washington huge-pass feel to it though, and that wasn't a bad thing. Although there was some climbing, looking at my photos, it was worth it.

            Camp that night was in a great little valley, surrounded by tall bushes. I felt super cozy, like nature was giving me a hug. The bushes were also facing just the right way so I could wake up to the sun the next morning. I went to sleep happy.

            <br>
            I was super ready to get to town the next morning because I was hungry and I could see clouds in the distance. They were still far out, but I could tell the snowstorm was a-coming. I woke up early without even meaning to, and packed up camp with the sunrise.

              Getting an early start

            I was only about 15 and a half miles out from Highway 74, where I'd hitch, and it was a relatively easy terrain hiking day. But the last 3 miles got a little stressful because I could see the massive storm clouds starting to cover me, and I could hear thunder getting closer too. 
            <br><br>
            <div class="captioned-image">
              <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6b807pjne37mqhn/trailview3.jpg?raw=1" alt="view from the trail">
              <br>
              Before the clouds started getting too close, it was actually a beautiful day
            </div>
            <br>
            It wasn't a super easy hitch, and it actually started raining on me for a while before someone stopped for me. Many cars passed me, and it began to rain even harder, so I put on my best sad, cold, and miserable face on, hoping someone would stop for me soon.
            <br><br>
            Finally, a woman drove into the trailhead parking lot I walked through to get to the highway, turned around, and picked me up. She was a PCT section hiker, and knew what I was doing from seeing my pack. Thank goodness she stopped because it was actually getting really cold out there in the rain! 
            <br><br>
            She dropped me off at the grocery store, and I could tell as I was walking around, grabbing some snacks, that Idyllwild is a hiker town. Everyone who saw my bag wished me luck or was happy to tell me I was almost at the end. It was really sweet.
            <br><br>
            I stopped at a coffee shop for some warm coffee (and vegan banana bread), and booked a room at one of the inns in town. Guys, I had a wood stove to warm up the room. It was magical. 
            <br><br>
            It started to snow in the evening, and I spent all night lying in bed watching TV. Ctrl+Z and Katie were staying at the same inn in another room, and another hiker, Waist Deep, whom I had met for the <a href="https://tiffanyc.net/pct-journal/10-or-sectionf.html">first time a long ways back</a> up in Oregon at Big Lake Youth Camp, was also spending the night at the inn. We were all holed up the following day to wait out the storm. 
            <br><br>
            I had gotten in touch with a few other SOBOs I knew were ahead of me, and found out there was another group a little ways ahead in Warner Springs hiding indoors during the storm, including Timber. Another group was at a trail angel's house in Julian a few dozen miles ahead of that, including Yahtzee and Big Tex. I was glad to hear everyone would be safe during this storm, because it didn't stop snowing at all the next day. 
            <br><br>
            I spent most of the zero indoors watching YouTube videos (I'm really exciting) and getting coffee (and more vegan banana bread!) with Ctrl+Z and Katie at the cafe. We spent that night in Ctrl+Z and Katie's room making microwave s'mores and playing games in front of the fireplace.

            </div>
            <br>
            I tried to burn the night into my memory, because I knew it was going to be the last zero I took on the trail (barring something terrible happening between Idyllwild and the end).
