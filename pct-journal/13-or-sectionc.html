        When we finally reached Highway 209, where the trail would split into the standard PCT and the Crater Lake alternate route (which most of the hikers I met along the trail would take because it’s pretty epic), Blue and I stopped for a sit before I headed off to Chemult and he continued on for a few more miles. 
        <br><br>
        A very kind couple who was packing up their car came to chat with us briefly, and offered us some of the biggest, freshest peaches I had ever seen. They were amazing, especially in the heat of the day.

          Easily the best peach I've ever had
        </div>
        <br>
        Jawad showed up a little while later, and we headed off to Chemult. I was hoping I’d catch up with Blue at some point later. The motel we stayed at felt like a small AirBnb and was very cozy! The timing was also kind of funny because Jawad’s and my anniversary was the day before. Time to get some real sleep after a long few days, and prepare for seeing Crater Lake for the first time the following day.

        The first 11 miles of the day were the Crater Lake Rim Trail. 
        <br><br>
        For some reason, I expected something called a Rim Trail to be some version of flat. I don’t know why I thought that, because clearly a rim doesn’t imply flat, but I was 100% incorrect. The Rim Trail was most certainly not flat.

          The Rim Trail wasn't what I expected
        </div>
        <br>
        Crater Lake was insanely huge, and the water was a crazy blue color. It was cool to walk around it and get to see it up close and personal like that.
        <br><br>
        A large family saw me as I was walking by and asked if I had camped in the park. I explained that I was hiking the PCT, and they were super surprised to hear that this was a thing people did. It was actually kind of a refreshing conversation because as a thru-hiker, you really start to exist in a bubble, and almost everyone you talk to is a thru-hiker. They asked me a few questions, like how long I had been out and how long I’d expect to take, and as someone who never tires of talking about the trail, I was happy to stop and chat for a while.
        <br><br>
        As beautiful as Crater Lake was, I admit I didn’t love it as much as I thought I did. I assume a big part of that was that this was probably some of the steepest trail I had encountered in Oregon thus far, and I had a relatively big resupply to get myself to Ashland. 
        <br><br>

          What an incredible shade of blue
        </div>
        <br>
        It was an extremely dry day, because there wasn’t any water until after the Rim Trail, and it was a very hot and exposed day. The only water I came across was at the end of the Rim Trail, and there wasn’t going to be any more water for another 20 miles. I ate dinner and cameled up there, drinking as much water as I could before I left.
        <br><br>
        I camped alone that night. The entire area was a burn zone, so I could hear trees creaking all through the night. I thought more than once about the possibility that something could fall on my tent. 
        <br><br>

          A lot of precarious-sounding dead trees
        </div>
        <br>
        The next day, I entered mosquito hell. It was by far the worst area of mosquitoes I had encountered on the trail. I set up camp that night early because the mosquitoes were just that bad. In fact, I didn’t even pull out my head net all day because I knew that if I stopped, they would get to me. It was a terrible campsite, in the middle of the worst of the mosquitoes, but I just couldn’t bring myself to walk anymore. I set up my tent while walking in circles. 
        <br><br>
        It was probably one of my least favorite campsites on the entire trail. Not only was I hearing the most terrible buzzing of mosquitoes all night, knowing they were just waiting for me, but I could hear bears barking throughout the night too. I barely got any sleep. I camped alone, too, and I was starting to miss camping with others regularly again.

        <br>
        The next morning, as I was preparing to exit the safety of my tent and start packing up camp, Blue walked by. I called him over, and I was really excited to see him again. Our paths just kept crossing!
