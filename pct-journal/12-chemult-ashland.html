      The first 11 miles of the day were the Crater Lake Rim Trail. 
      <br><br>
      For some reason, I expected something called a Rim Trail to be some version of flat. I don’t know why I thought that, because clearly a rim doesn’t imply flat, but I was 100% incorrect. The Rim Trail was most certainly not flat.

      <br>
      Crater Lake was insanely huge, and the water was a crazy blue color. It was cool to walk around it and get to see it up close and personal like that.
      <br><br>
      A large family saw me as I was walking by and asked if I had camped in the park. I explained that I was hiking the PCT, and they were super surprised to hear that this was a thing people did. It was actually kind of a refreshing conversation because as a thru-hiker, you really start to exist in a bubble, and almost everyone you talk to is a thru-hiker. They asked me a few questions, like how long I had been out and how long I’d expect to take, and as someone who never tires of talking about the trail, I was happy to stop and chat for a while.
      <br><br>
      As beautiful as Crater Lake was, I admit I didn’t love it as much as I thought I did. I assume a big part of that was that this was probably some of the steepest trail I had encountered in Oregon thus far, and I had a relatively big resupply to get myself to Ashland.

      <br>
      It was an extremely dry day, because there wasn’t any water until after the Rim Trail, and it was a very hot and exposed day. The only water I came across was at the end of the Rim Trail, and there wasn’t going to be any more water for another 20 miles. I ate dinner and cameled up there, drinking as much water as I could before I left.
      <br><br>
      I camped alone that night. The entire area was a burn zone, so I could hear trees creaking all through the night. I thought more than once about the possibility that something could fall on my tent.

      <br>
      The next day, I entered mosquito hell. It was by far the worst area of mosquitoes I had encountered on the trail. I set up camp that night early because the mosquitoes were just that bad. In fact, I didn’t even pull out my head net all day because I knew that if I stopped, they would get to me. It was a terrible campsite, in the middle of the worst of the mosquitoes, but I just couldn’t bring myself to walk anymore. I set up my tent while walking in circles.

      </div>
      <br>
      It was probably one of my least favorite campsites on the entire trail. Not only was I hearing the most terrible buzzing of mosquitoes all night, knowing they were just waiting for me, but I could hear bears barking throughout the night too. I barely got any sleep. I camped alone, too, and I was starting to miss camping with others regularly again.

      <br>
      The next morning, as I was preparing to exit the safety of my tent and start packing up camp, Blue walked by. I called him over, and I was really excited to see him again. Our paths kept crossing!
      <br><br>
      I ran into more trail magic that day near Fish Lake. A trail angel named Clementine was doing a bunch of trail magic in the area, setting up in a few different locations over several days. I got some jelly beans and an orange and was very happy to sit in a chair.

      </div>
      <br>
      Later that day, before I hit camp, I heard Wookie sounds behind me. There was Blue again -- he had stopped at Fish Lake to grab a soda, so I had passed him while he was there. We ended up camping next to a cabin on the trail, which had a water pump there that was broken. I’m so glad I ran into him, because there’s no way I would have been able to handle using the broken pump myself because I’m just not tall enough, and it was the only water around!

      What a miserable day the next day. The good news: we reached 900 miles! The less good news: I got rained on for the first time in a while, and all of my stuff got completely soaked. There weren’t any campsites anywhere near me by the time I was reaching my breaking point near the end of the day, so I ended up setting up my tent in a bunch of weeds and grass, where I could hardly even stake in my tent. I was barely able to sleep because everything was totally soaked. At least tomorrow was town day.

      </div>
      <br>
      The next morning, I packed up, and at the top of the next climb, I pulled out all of my stuff and laid it out in the sun to dry out. While at the top, I had service, so I sent a message to Blue and asked if he wanted to split a room because I was ready to sleep indoors again. He said yes, and I was just glad to have figured out what my plans were that night.

      <br>
      After my stuff had dried out, I booked it into town. This part of the trail wasn’t flat at all, and that was super frustrating because I was ready to get to Ashland! When I got into Callahan’s Lodge, which is right on the trail, I decided to stop into the restaurant and get myself a plate of spaghetti. Real, cooked food. That put me in a much better mood.
      <br><br>
      <div class="captioned-image">
        <img height="400" src="images/journal_entry_12/highway.jpg" alt="highway">
        <br>
        Finally hitting the highway; Callahan's right around the corner
      </div>
      <br>
      It was time for me to hitch by myself for the first time, and I’m glad it was here, because I walked out of the Lodge, stuck out my thumb, and a car stopped for me 15 seconds later. Apparently a lot of Uber/Lyft drivers do a lot of travel between Ashland (several miles off the trail) and Callahan’s Lodge (right on the trail) during the hiker season, and if they see you after they’ve dropped someone off, they’ll often stop for you. So kind!
      <br><br>

      I got dropped off at the motel Blue and I planned to stay at, and finally kicked back and relaxed. We had planned to take a zero in Ashland the next day, so I was ready to relax as hard as I possibly could. We hadn’t taken a zero since Cascade Locks, and we were definitely feeling it. I spent that whole zero watching The Office and doing absolutely nothing.

      Blue and I planned to head out the next day, but I got a message from Yahtzee that she had just made it into town, and wanted to say hello. We decided to all go to the Indian restaurant in Ashland because it had an all-you-can-eat buffet, and I don’t think I need to explain why. Somehow, during that lunch, she convinced us both to take another zero. She was very persuasive.

      <br>
      Honestly, I was feeling incredibly burnt out after almost completing Oregon, so it was a great decision. I spent that whole zero watching The Office and doing absolutely nothing… again. It was exquisite.
