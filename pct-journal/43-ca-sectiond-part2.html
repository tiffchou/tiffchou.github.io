            The hike up Mount Baden-Powell wasn’t easy, but the views were great. It was only about 17 miles to the highway to Wrightwood, where I’d be resupplying, so I wasn’t in a big rush.

            Mount Baden-Powell summit isn’t on the trail, but it’s only about a tenth of a mile off. The weather was gorgeous and it was still early, so it was a no-brainer. I happened to reach the summit around the same time Ctrl+Z and Katie got there, so we were able to sit around and take pictures.

            After spending some time at the summit, I kept on. There were some ridiculously long switchbacks, and so many of them. It wasn’t a flat day by any means, but I was still able to reach the highway pretty early in the afternoon.

            It wasn’t an easy hitch into town. About 20 minutes after I got to the highway, Ctrl+Z and Katie caught up, and the 3 of us tried to get into town. It still took a while, but a pick-up truck stopped for us, and I got to ride in a truck bed for the first time. It was a lot of fun!

            We stopped at the Mountain Hardware store, where PCT hikers can get their special commemorative PCT pin, and I was able to get in contact with a trail angel named Jeff who was nice enough to let the 3 of us stay with him overnight. 
            <br><br>
            Before heading over to his place, we stopped at the post office and grocery store for resupply, then the brewery for beer and pretzels. Before we left, 2 women stopped to talk to us, and had Katie read a random text one of them had sent to a guy for the other woman. There was apparently a whole drama with one of them being with a guy who had a girlfriend or something? I still don’t really know. But they ended up asking us a lot of questions about the PCT once they figured out that’s why we were in Wrightwood in the first place. 
            <br><br>
            Sleeping indoors was great that night because the nights were getting really cold, and I even got to take a warm shower. Thanks, Jeff! He was nice enough to give us a ride back to the trail the next day too.

            It was a long day, with a steep climb in the very beginning, which I didn’t love, then about 20 miles of steady downhill, which I think I loved even less. I was planning to camp a little bit before Cajon Pass, which was about 28 miles after Wrightwood, but I got a message from Ctrl+Z and Katie asking if I wanted in on a room at the hotel in Cajon Pass. I messaged Yahtzee to see if she wanted in too, since I knew she was around, and we all decided to split a room. I couldn’t pass it up (I mean we were talking about laundry, showers, sleeping indoors, and continental breakfast for $20 apiece), but I had been hiking slow that day, so I had to pick up the pace. I knew I wouldn’t get in until late no matter what.

            There was little water that day. I also hadn’t hiked that late into the night on the trail yet up until that point, so that day felt insanely long. I didn’t get to the hotel until around 10:00 PM. We saw the other hikers we met at Casa de Luna and Hiker Heaven there too, so it seems like everyone had the same idea. 
            <br><br>
            Cajon Pass isn’t really a town, it’s just a highway junction. There are a couple convenience stores, some fast food places, and the hotel. There’s no reason to take a zero here. And I totally didn’t mean to, but the others decided they were going to stay another night, and I figured $20 for another night indoors was worth it. Admittedly, I was getting a little burnt out on hiking, and taking extra zeroes sounded great in general.

            It was also Yahtzee’s birthday, so Katie and I went to the Circle K convenience store next door to get as much birthday stuff as we could. They had a surprisingly large variety; we were able to get birthday cake bites, a birthday cake 3 Musketeers bar, and hot fudge sundae Poptarts.

            <br>
            We wrapped everything using our dry sacks and plastic bags, sat around, and had Yahtzee open up all of her presents. Happy birthday, Yahtzee!
