      Immediately after Shelter Cove was a really obnoxious climb. The general flatness of Oregon was making me soft!

      That night, I camped at a really cool single completely exposed campsite that had some epic views and a great sunset. By now, the moon was like a freaking street lamp, which was so bright it actually made it difficult to sleep.

      The next day was almost completely dry. It was a 25-mile stretch with no water on trail. There were two possible water sources, but one was a steep half-mile off the trail, and the other was a full mile off the trail. I decided to see if I could make those 25 miles without carrying any water, which basically meant doing a long day.
      <br><br>
      I was going to try to see if I could break 30 miles.
      <br><br>
      The beginning of the dry stretch was a water cache several miles into my day, and thank goodness for it, or the water carry would have been even longer, and I likely would have had to hike off-trail to get to one of those aforementioned water sources. It’s hard to properly express just how grateful us thru-hikers are for the trail angels who maintain the caches. I don’t want to say that the trail would not be doable without the caches, but it would certainly make things a lot harder, and some water carries would be prohibitively long for many hikers. Thank you, trail angels!
      <br><br>

        Seriously, I'd be so screwed without you amazing trail angels
      </div>
      <br>
      The caches were right at a large campsite, so I decided to sit around and eat a proper freeze-dried meal for lunch in the shade since I could tell it was going to be a long day. For half an hour, I enjoyed my mushy beans and rice while moving from spot to spot to avoid the yellowjackets everywhere, and trying to keep my food bag being raided by some overly nosey squirrels.
      <br><br>
      It wasn’t a flat day, but I knew there was a site 33 miles away from where I left that morning that was supposed to have some epic views and really nice campsites. I had checked the elevation profile for the day and I knew it wasn’t supposed to be flat, but I just felt good that day. I think a big part of it was that I realized my body was getting stronger after Washington. I thought I wasn’t getting all that much stronger because my mileage wasn’t increasing so much in Washington, but when things started flattening out in Oregon, my daily mileage had clearly gone up.

      I knew water would be an issue, so I carried as much water as I could (which wasn’t that much, honestly, since I hadn’t needed a big water capacity until this point), and I had a bunch of electrolyte tablets I decided to use in all of my water so I would retain it better. Unfortunately, I only had ones that were caffeinated, but I had to make do with what I had.
      <br><br>
      Because I was focused completely on my miles for the day, I didn’t take a single photo until I got to camp after lunch. But guess what, guys? I did it! I pulled off my longest day, my first 30-miler at 33 miles! I even made it in time to see the end of the sunset.

      <br>
      When I got to camp, someone poked their head out of their tent, and it was Blue! It made me happy to see someone I recognized again. The fact that I kept running into him was fun, and I ended up finding a smaller trail family for a little while in him.
      <br><br>
      Of course, because I had been basically drinking coffee all day in the form of electrolyte water and was riding the adrenaline of the day, I wasn’t able to fall asleep until 4:00 AM. Oops!
      <br><br>
      The next day, I hit the high point of both Washington and Oregon, which was pretty cool! I was surprised to learn the highest point in Oregon was higher up than in Washington given how hilly Washington was compared to Oregon’s flatness.

      It was a ridiculously hot day, and I was absolutely shot after the previous day and getting almost no sleep. I hiked with Blue for a while later in the day, Even though I tend to be a solo hiker, the trail can feel lonely at times, and it was nice to have company this time.
      <br><br>
      When we finally reached Highway 209, where the trail would split into the standard PCT and the Crater Lake alternate route (which most of the hikers I met along the trail would take because it’s pretty epic), Blue and I stopped for a sit before I headed off to Chemult and he continued on for a few more miles. 
      <br><br>
      A very kind couple who was packing up their car came to chat with us briefly, and offered us some of the biggest, freshest peaches I had ever seen. They were amazing, especially in the heat of the day.

        Easily the best peach I've ever had

      <br>
      Jawad showed up a little while later, and we headed off to Chemult. I was hoping I’d catch up with Blue at some point later. The motel we stayed at felt like a small AirBnb and was very cozy! The timing was also kind of funny because Jawad’s and my anniversary was the day before. Time to get some real sleep after a long few days, and prepare for seeing Crater Lake for the first time the following day.
