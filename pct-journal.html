      Every evening at camp, I spent a few minutes on my phone typing up a few sentences about my day. As my hike continued on, my daily journal entries got longer and longer, as I realized I wanted to remember as much as I could later on about my hike. It’s hardly an exaggeration to say that hiking the Pacifc Crest Trail was one of the most incredible, difficult, painful, absolutely unforgettable experiences I’ve ever had, and I’m so grateful every day that I was able to make it happen.
